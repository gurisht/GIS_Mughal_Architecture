This project aims at visually displaying all the well-known Mughal Architectures in New Delhi, India. 
Each location displayed is precise, and clicking on it opens a pop-up which leads to further information on the location.

Each Point of Interest in this application is represented as a 'hotlink' with its own unique icon. 
Relevant menu items are created to support the interface of the application so as to display it correctly. 
To interact with the Points of Interest select the first layer from the TOC, click on the HotLink(HJ) icon and start clicking.
